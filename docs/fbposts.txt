3. Became contest leader
4. Became team leader
5. Passed friend(s) in the friend's leaderboard
6. Full score

TODO:
1. Need to find the BEST story to publish based on priorities of stories set in the general settings
2. Keep stories meta data (including priorities) in settins - allow attaching dynamic data to stories such as the friends I passed...

3. New rank share story (a story in the list but not in the priorities - should always be published if during quiz - what if got new rank as a result of the last question in the quiz and quiz finished??)
