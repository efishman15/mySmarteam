# Branch Metrics Web SDK

This README outlines the functionality of the Branch Metrics Web SDK, and how to easily incorporate it into a [Web](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/WEB_GUIDE.md#linkdata-callback) or [Cordova/PhoneGap](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/CORDOVA_GUIDE.md#linkdata-callback) app.

## Overview

The Branch Web SDK provides an easy way to interact with the Branch API on your website, web app, or PhoneGap/Cordova mobile app. It requires no frameworks, is 100% native JavaScript and is only ~9K gzipped.

To use the Web SDK, you'll need to first initialize it with your Branch Key found in your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). You'll also need to register when your users login with `setIdentity`, and when they logout with `logout`.

Once initialized, the Branch Web SDK allows you to create and share links with a banner (web only), over SMS, or your own methods by generating deep links. It also offers event tracking, access to referrals, and management of credits.

## Register Your App

Getting started with either a Web or Cordova integration is simple, and begins with obtaining a Branch Key. You can sign up for your own Branch Key at [https://dashboard.branch.io](https://dashboard.branch.io)

## Web Based Integration

### [Full Documentation for the Web SDK](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/WEB_GUIDE.md)

Adding the Branch Web SDK source code to your project can be done manually, or by using Bower or npm: `bower install branch-sdk` or `npm install branch-sdk` respectively.

__Be sure to replace `BRANCH KEY` with your actual Branch Key found in your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings).__

**[Formerly App ID](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** Note that for the time being, initializing the Web SDK with an App ID will still work, it is strongly recomended you switch to using your live and test Branch Keys.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

	// INSERT INIT CODE

	branch.init('BRANCH KEY', function(err, data) {
    	// callback to handle err or data
	});
</script>
```

## Cordova/PhoneGap

### [Full Documentation for the Cordova Web SDK](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/CORDOVA_GUIDE.md)

The Web SDK is provided as a plugin for Cordova and can be installed with Cordova plugin or the Plugman tool.  Point the tool at this repositry, https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK.git.  For example:

```sh
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK.git
```

You should initialize the Branch SDK session once the 'deviceready' event fires and each time the 'resume' event fires.  See the example code below. You will need your Branch Key from the Branch dashboard.

```js
  branch.init("YOUR BRANCH KEY HERE", function(err, data) {
  	app.initComplete(err, data);
  });
```

## Appcelerator Titanum

### [Full Documentation for the Titanium Web SDK](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/TITANIUM_GUIDE.md)

The Web SDK is provided as a module for Titanium.

You should initialize the Branch SDK session once the 'deviceready' event fires and each time the 'resume' event fires.  See the example code below. You will need your Branch Key from the Branch dashboard.

```js
  branch.init("YOUR BRANCH KEY HERE", function(err, data) {
  	app.initComplete(err, data);
  });
```

## Commonly Used Features

#### App Smart Banner
While only available for websites and web apps (not Cordova), the app smart banner is one of the most widely used features of the Web SDK. A few short lines of code will produce an automatically generated, highly customizeable banner at either the top or bottom of the page it is installed on. The banner automatically styles itself for Android, iOS, and desktop, and generates a mobile deep link if on a mobile deive, or displays a "TXT me the app form" if on desktop. If you are looking for a very simple way of getting deeplinking setup on your website - both desktop and mobile - the Smart banner is a great start!

For an in-depth explanation of everything the App Smart Banner can do, see the [Smart Banner Guide](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/SMART_BANNER_GUIDE.md)!

#### Short link generation
Powerful, customizeable, and easy-to-create deeplinks are what Branch does best. The Web SDK delivers on this promise of providing a simple and powerful function for generating short deep links asynchronously: `link()`. The method has all of the same options and parameters available on the public API `POST /v1/url` endpoint, and is called from a robust queueing mechanism and XHRRequest implementation with JSONP fallback that is well tested down to IE9, and every major browser.

## Contributing
Whether you are an avid engineer, a partner, or a Branch employee, we activley welcome feature ideas and pull requests! Prior to actually writing code for a feature, it is best to reach out to us first, as we may already have something in the pipeline.

To build the Web SDK, you'll need to run `npm install` to grab the necessary packages, be sure you have [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (comes with Mac OSX), [perl](http://learn.perl.org/installing/osx.html), and the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) (Closure compiler is automatically installed when you run `make` the first time.)

For an in-depth guide to working with developing for the Web SDK, refer to the [release documentation](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK/blob/master/RELEASE_DOCUMENTATION.md).
