# Full Documentation for Cordova SDK

This documentation outlines the functionality of the Branch Metrics Cordova SDK, and how to easily incorporate it into a Cordova app. The Cordova SDK shares the same code base as the Branch Web SDK, and includes functions to call all of the same API endpoints.

Live demo of the Web SDK: [https://cdn.branch.io/example.html](https://cdn.branch.io/example.html)

To use the Cordova SDK, you'll need to first initialize it with your Branch Key found in your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). You'll also need to register when your users login with `setIdentity`, and when they logout with `logout`.

### Register you app

You can sign up for your own Branch Key at [https://dashboard.branch.io](https://dashboard.branch.io)

### Quick Install of Cordova/Phonegap SDK

This Web SDK can also be used for Cordova/Phonegap applications.  It is provided as a plugin and can be installed with Cordova plugin or the Plugman tool.  Point the tool at this repositry, https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Cordova-Ionic-PhoneGap-Deferred-Deep-Linking-SDK.  For example:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Cordova-Ionic-PhoneGap-Deferred-Deep-Linking-SDK
```

Note that this SDK is meant for use with full Cordova/PhoneGap apps.  If you are building a hybrid app using an embedded web view and you want to access the Branch API from native code you will want to use the platform specific SDKs and pass data into Javascript if needed.

### Running Cordova Testbed App
This repo includes a sample app, that demonstrates all of the available methods in the Branch Cordova SDK.
Building this app is very simple:

Switch to the Cordova dir
```js
$ cd cordova-testbed
```

Run the init script to install all the required plugins
```js
$ ./init.sh
```

Build the Cordova app and launch in the iOS emulator
```sh
$ cordova emulate ios
```

#### Initialization and Event Handling

You should initialize the Branch SDK session once the `deviceready` event fires and each time the `resume` event fires.  See the example code below. You will need your Branch Key from the Branch dashboard.

```js
  branch.init("YOUR BRANCH KEY HERE", function(err, data) {
  	app.initComplete(err, data);
  });
```
**[Formerly `getInstance() and initSession()`](CORDOVA_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md)**

Here is the location of the Branch Key that you will need for the `branch.init` call above (_formerly app id, which is now depreciated_):

![app id](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BranchMetrics/Smart-App-Banner-Deep-Linking-Web-SDK/master/resources/app_id.png)

The session close will be sent automatically on any 'pause' event.

_____

#### Register an activity for direct deep linking (optional but recommended)

In your project's manifest file, you can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding the second intent filter block. Also, make sure to change **yourapp** to a unique string that represents your app name.

Secondly, make sure that this activity is launched as a singleTask. This is important to handle proper deep linking from other apps like Facebook.

Typically, you would register some sort of splash activity that handles routing for your app.

```xml
<activity
	android:name="com.yourapp.SplashActivity"
	android:label="@string/app_name"
	<!-- Make sure the activity is launched as "singleTask" -->
	android:launchMode="singleTask"
	 >
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
		<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
	</intent-filter>

	<!-- Add this intent filter below, and change yourapp to your app name -->
	<intent-filter>
		<data android:scheme="yourapp" android:host="open" />
		<action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
		<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
		<category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
	</intent-filter>
</activity>
```
_____

### iOS plist

#### Add your Branch Key to your project

After you register your app, your Branch Key can be retrieved on the [Settings](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings) page of the dashboard. Now you need to add it to YourProject-Info.plist (Info.plist for Swift).

1. In plist file, mouse hover "Information Property List" which is the root item under the Key column.
1. After about half a second, you will see a "+" sign appear. Click it.
1. In the newly added row, fill in "branch_key" for its key, leave type as String, and enter your app's Branch Key obtained in above steps in the value column.
1. Save the plist file.

#### Register a URI scheme direct deep linking (optional but recommended)

You can register your app to respond to direct deep links (yourapp:// in a mobile browser) by adding a URI scheme in the YourProject-Info.plist file. Make sure to change **yourapp** to a unique string that represents your app name.

1. In Xcode, click on YourProject-Info.plist on the left.
1. Find URL Types and click the right arrow. (If it doesn't exist, right click anywhere and choose Add Row. Scroll down and choose URL Types)
1. Add "yourapp", where yourapp is a unique string for your app, as an item in URL Schemes as below:

![URL Scheme Demo](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/branchhost/urlScheme.png)

Alternatively, you can add the URI scheme in your project's Info page.

1. In XCode, click your project in the Navigator (on the left side).
1. Select the "Info" tab.
1. Expand the "URL Types" section at the bottom.
1. Click the "+" sign to add a new URI Scheme, as below:

![URL Scheme Demo](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/branchhost/urlType.png)

### SDK Method Queue

Initializing the SDK is an asynchronous method with a callback, so it may seem as though you would need to place any method calls that will execute immediately inside the `branch.init()` callback. We've made it even easier than that, by building in a queue to the SDK! The only thing that is required is that `branch.init()` is called prior to any other methods. All SDK methods called are guaranteed to: 1. be executed in the order that they were called, and 2. wait to execute until the previous SDK method finishes. Therefore, it is 100% allowable to do something like:

```js
branch.init(...);
branch.banner(...);
```

If `branch.init()` fails, all subsequent branch methods will fail.

### setDebug(debug) 

**Parameters**

**debug**: `boolean`, _required_ - Set the SDK debug flag.

Setting the SDK debug flag will generate a new device ID each time the app is installed
instead of possibly using the same device id.  This is useful when testing.

This needs to be set before the Branch.init call!!!

___



### init(branch_key, options, callback) 

**Parameters**

**branch_key**: `string`, _required_ - Your Branch [live key](http://dashboard.branch.io/settings), or (depreciated) your app id.

**options**: `Object`, _optional_ - { *isReferrable*: _Is this a referrable session_ }.

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

THE "isReferrable" OPTION IS ONLY USED IN THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN
AND THE TITANIUM MODULE

Adding the Branch script to your page automatically creates a window.branch
object with all the external methods described below. All calls made to
Branch methods are stored in a queue, so even if the SDK is not fully
instantiated, calls made to it will be queued in the order they were
originally called.
If the session was opened from a referring link, `data()` will also return the referring link click as `referring_link`, which gives you the ability to continue the click flow.

The init function on the Branch object initiates the Branch session and
creates a new user session, if it doesn't already exist, in
`sessionStorage`.

**Useful Tip**: The init function returns a data object where you can read
the link the user was referred by.

##### Usage
```js
branch.init(
    branch_key,
    options,
    callback (err, data),
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
     "Error message",
     {
          data_parsed:        { },                          // If the user was referred from a link, and the link has associated data, the data is passed in here.
          referring_identity: '12345',                      // If the user was referred from a link, and the link was created by a user with an identity, that identity is here.
          has_app:            true,                         // Does the user have the app installed already?
          identity:           'BranchUser',                 // Unique string that identifies the user
          referring_link:          'https://bnc.lt/c/jgg75-Gjd3' // The referring link click, if available.
     }
);
```

**Note:** `Branch.init` must be called prior to calling any other Branch functions.
___



### data(callback) 

**Parameters**

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

Returns the same session information and any referring data, as
`Branch.init`, but does not require the `app_id`. This is meant to be called
after `Branch.init` has been called if you need the session information at a
later point.
If the Branch session has already been initialized, the callback will return
immediately, otherwise, it will return once Branch has been initialized.
___



### first(callback) 

**Parameters**

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

Returns the same session information and any referring data, as
`Branch.init` did when the app was first installed. This is meant to be called
after `Branch.init` has been called if you need the first session information at a
later point.
If the Branch session has already been initialized, the callback will return
immediately, otherwise, it will return once Branch has been initialized.

___



### setIdentity(identity, callback) 

**Parameters**

**identity**: `string`, _required_ - a string uniquely identifying the user - often a user ID or email address.

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback that returns the user's Branch identity id and unique link.

**[Formerly `identify()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

Sets the identity of a user and returns the data. To use this function, pass
a unique string that identifies the user - this could be an email address,
UUID, Facebook ID, etc.

##### Usage
```js
branch.setIdentity(
    identity,
    callback (err, data)
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
     "Error message",
     {
          identity_id:             '12345', // Server-generated ID of the user identity, stored in `sessionStorage`.
          link:                    'url',   // New link to use (replaces old stored link), stored in `sessionStorage`.
          referring_data_parsed:    { },      // Returns the initial referring data for this identity, if exists, as a parsed object.
          referring_identity:      '12345'  // Returns the initial referring identity for this identity, if exists.
     }
);
```

# Deeplinking Methods

## Creating a deep linking link



### link(data, callback) 

**Parameters**

**data**: `Object`, _required_ - link data and metadata.

**callback**: `function`, _required_ - returns a string of the Branch deep linking URL.

**[Formerly `createLink()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

Creates and returns a deep linking URL.  The `data` parameter can include an
object with optional data you would like to store, including Facebook
[Open Graph data](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph).

**data** The dictionary to embed with the link. Accessed as session or install parameters from the SDK.

**Note**
You can customize the Facebook OG tags of each URL if you want to dynamically share content by using the following optional keys in the data dictionary. Please use this [Facebook tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object) to debug your OG tags!

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$og_title" | The title you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_description" | The description you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_image_url" | The URL for the image you'd like to appear for the link in social media
| "$og_video" | The URL for the video
| "$og_url" | The URL you'd like to appear
| "$og_redirect" | If you want to bypass our OG tags and use your own, use this key with the URL that contains your site's metadata.

Also, you can set custom redirection by inserting the following optional keys in the dictionary:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$desktop_url" | Where to send the user on a desktop or laptop. By default it is the Branch-hosted text-me service
| "$android_url" | The replacement URL for the Play Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ios_url" | The replacement URL for the App Store to send the user if they don't have the app. _Only necessary if you want a mobile web splash_
| "$ipad_url" | Same as above but for iPad Store
| "$fire_url" | Same as above but for Amazon Fire Store
| "$blackberry_url" | Same as above but for Blackberry Store
| "$windows_phone_url" | Same as above but for Windows Store
| "$after_click_url" | When a user returns to the browser after going to the app, take them to this URL. _iOS only; Android coming soon_

You have the ability to control the direct deep linking of each link as well:

| Key | Value
| --- | ---
| "$deeplink_path" | The value of the deep link path that you'd like us to append to your URI. For example, you could specify "$deeplink_path": "radio/station/456" and we'll open the app with the URI "yourapp://radio/station/456?link_click_id=branch-identifier". This is primarily for supporting legacy deep linking infrastructure.
| "$always_deeplink" | true or false. (default is not to deep link first) This key can be specified to have our linking service force try to open the app, even if we're not sure the user has the app installed. If the app is not installed, we fall back to the respective app store or $platform_url key. By default, we only open the app if we've seen a user initiate a session in your app from a Branch link (has been cookied and deep linked by Branch).

#### Usage
```js
branch.link(
    data,
    callback (err, link)
);
```

#### Example
```js
branch.link({
    tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ],
    channel: 'facebook',
    feature: 'dashboard',
    stage: 'new user',
    data: {
        mydata: 'something',
        foo: 'bar',
        '$desktop_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com',
        '$ios_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
        '$ipad_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ipad',
        '$android_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
        '$og_app_id': '12345',
        '$og_title': 'My App',
        '$og_description': 'My app\'s description.',
        '$og_image_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
    }
}, function(err, link) {
    console.log(err, link);
});
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
    "Error message",
    'https://bnc.lt/l/3HZMytU-BW' // Branch deep linking URL
);
```



### sendSMS(phone, linkData, options, callback) 

**Parameters**

**phone**: `string`, _required_ - phone number to send SMS to

**linkData**: `Object`, _required_ - object of link data

**options**: `Object`, _optional_ - options: make_new_link, which forces the creation of a new link even if one already exists

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - Returns an error if unsuccessful

**[Formerly `SMSLink()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

A robust function to give your users the ability to share links via SMS. If
the user navigated to this page via a Branch link, `sendSMS` will send that
same link. Otherwise, it will create a new link with the data provided in
the `params` argument. `sendSMS` also registers a click event with the
`channel` pre-filled with `'sms'` before sending an sms to the provided
`phone` parameter. This way the entire link click event is recorded starting
with the user sending an sms.

**Note**: `sendSMS` will *automatically* send a previously generated link click,
along with the `data` object in the original link. Therefore, it is unneccessary for the
`data()` method to be called to check for an already existing link. If a link already
exists, `sendSMS` will simply ignore the `data` object passed to it, and send the existing link.
If this behaivior is not desired, set `make_new_link: true` in the `options` object argument
of `sendSMS`, and `sendSMS` will always make a new link.

**Supports international SMS**.

#### Usage
```js
branch.sendSMS(
    phone,
    linkData,
    options,
    callback (err, data)
);
```

##### Example
```js
branch.sendSMS(
    phone: '9999999999',
    {
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
        channel: 'facebook',
        feature: 'dashboard',
        stage: 'new user',
        data: {
            mydata: 'something',
            foo: 'bar',
            '$desktop_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com',
            '$ios_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
            '$ipad_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ipad',
            '$android_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
            '$og_app_id': '12345',
            '$og_title': 'My App',
            '$og_description': 'My app\'s description.',
            '$og_image_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
        }
    },
    { make_new_link: true }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.
    function(err) { console.log(err); }
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback("Error message");
```

# Referral system rewarding functionality
In a standard referral system, you have 2 parties: the original user and the invitee. Our system is flexible enough to handle rewards for all users for any actions. Here are a couple example scenarios:
1. Reward the original user for taking action (eg. inviting, purchasing, etc)
2. Reward the invitee for installing the app from the original user's referral link
3. Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)

These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the 'Reward Rules' section in the 'Referrals' tab on the dashboard.

Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call. This can allow users to cheat the system.

## Credit redemption



### redeem(amount, bucket, callback) 

**Parameters**

**amount**: `number`, _required_ - an `amount` (int) of number of credits to redeem

**bucket**: `string`, _required_ - the name of the `bucket` (string) of which bucket to redeem the credits from

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - returns an error if unsuccessful

**[Formerly `redeemCredits()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

Credits are stored in `buckets`, which you can define as points, currency, whatever makes sense for your app. When you want to redeem credits, call this method with the number of points to be redeemed, and the bucket to redeem them from.

```js
branch.redeem(
    amount, // Amount of credits to be redeemed
    bucket,  // String of bucket name to redeem credits from
    callback (err)
);
```

##### Example

```js
branch.redeem(
    5,
    "Rubies",
    function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback("Error message");
```
